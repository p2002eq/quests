I love Seru and I love this town do not get me wrong, but it still makes me sad to see someone cast out. He was forced to submit to the Question when he was found to be supplying [Recuso] with food, water, and medical supplies. Because of the power of the question, they soon found this out, and now he has to live amongst the very people he was helping.");

Because you are questioned by a Praesertum other than the one that you are in, it is kept unbiased. My brother committed crimes against the city by assisting the Recuso. The refused are sent to Marus Seru as punishment and [interfering] with that punishment is interfering with Seru's way.");

I could not check on him, and could not ask you to check on him either, or you would defy Seru. That is something that I could not ask of anyone. The Question is a horrible ordeal. You will either die from being cast to Marus Seru or from the draining power of the Question itself.");
