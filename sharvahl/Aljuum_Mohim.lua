Their ability to move in the darkness and attack in packs makes them a serious threat to any Vah Shir that walks beyond our city's gates. I fear them more than I fear the twisted little people that live in the caves around here. It is the duty of each citizen to help control the number of these creatures. Fill the bag that I just handed you with the jawbones of two young sonic wolves and I'll know that you have a real understanding of the ferocity of those creatures. If you return, I'll have something that you may find interesting.");

Well, now that you've seen them firsthand, I'll tell you how to deal with them like a true hunter. Take this hilt piece and show Hana Sulm. She'll give you some sketches. Once you have those sketches, go to Arms Historian Qua and purchase the tomes on Wolf Bane Lore or something like that. He'll know what you mean. You can use those books and the sketches to make a weapon that offers considerable power against those wolves. Once you have the weapon, bring it to me with your apprentice cloak.
