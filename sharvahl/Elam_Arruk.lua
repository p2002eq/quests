As a scout, there is one creature that roams the moor that you are going to need to focus on in particular. These creatures are wolf-like in their appearance, but have no need for sight and show absolutely no fear of the tactics that we usually use to scare off animals. They move in packs and attack swiftly. To learn their behavior, you will need to track a few down. Fill that bag with a few of their tongues and bring it back to me. Once you have seen them, I will be able to teach you more.");

Then heat the resulting powder in an oven by placing the powder and some water in a poison vial. Be sure not to over cook it.");
