You have shown us that you are ready to advance to the level of apprentice. I will send someone for your new cloak in a moment. While I am doing that, please use this bowl to prepare some spicy fish stew and take it to Kerr Tiparr in the Hollowshade outpost. It's not often that they get good food out there. If you don't remember the recipe, just ask cook Mylis. When you are done, please return with your old cloak and the empty pot. Always remember...
