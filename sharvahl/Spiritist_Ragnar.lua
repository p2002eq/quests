If their feelings were strong enough it would... well, that was part of the problem, no one knew what it was supposed to do.

All that we could do was give him a controlled intake of the potion for his addiction and try to treat his dementia. With his returning sanity came the realization of what he had done to his love. It was the most harrowing thing I have ever seen someone go through in all of my life... He is better now, but has never quite been the same and rarely speaks to strangers.
