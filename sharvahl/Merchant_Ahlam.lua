Once you find the roots just use the strainer to control the flow of water over the leaves. If you do it correctly you'll create a very potent brew. When you get it right bring the strainer back to me with a sample of your work.");

Here's your strainer back, I etched some runes into that should add to the potency of your brews. I hear the grimlings make a very potent sort of tea from the grimroot out in the forest, but the thought of drinking anything made from grimroot makes my stomach churn. At any rate, tinker a bit with that strainer and don't be afraid of trying some new brews with it. If you create anything interesting that you think I might like bring it to me so I can taste it.");
