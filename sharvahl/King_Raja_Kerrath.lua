---- Changes by Kagehi.
---- Shar_Vahl_Cit tracks the steps you take to gain your initiate cloak.
---- Since we don't want to hand people things that they can't normally get, or
---- stuff they haven't earned, we need to track which stage in the quest they
---- are at. 1 = Citizen Application. 2 = Cert. of Taxability, 3 = Stamped Cert.,
---- 4 = Note to King Raja, 5 Note 'from' the king, 6 = Notarized Application
---- and 7 = Initiate's Cloak.
