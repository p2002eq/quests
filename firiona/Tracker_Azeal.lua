--He will check the zone time every 30 seconds, and if it's 9 PM, he will respawn as a wandering form of himself that will path off and meet whoever is doing the quest.
-- Issue with the timer, so to get this working just moved the quest turn in to this NPC, since the other NPC (Tracker_Azeal_) wasn't spawning correctly.
