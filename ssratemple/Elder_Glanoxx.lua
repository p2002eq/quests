I trust that we are from somewhere else. These creatures claim to be gods. They claim to have created us from the filth of the mines. This cannot be. I have seen the face of our true god. He told me of their blasphemy. He came to me and handed me the knowledge of how to reach their Emperor. He taught me to resist the prying magic of the fanatics. Are you the crusaders of prophecy... the ones who walk in the mist?");

These items are kept by the Emperor's most loyal Taskmasters. Place with them the Ssreashzian Insignia. This item will be much harder to acquire. I am sure you will be successful... our lord walks with you. Please be swift.");
