I was with a small patrol of scouts watching for any indication of the Acrylia Caverns Grimlings sending aid to the grimlings in Tenebrous Mountains during one of the Validus Custodus campains to rid the tenebrous mines of the little buggers. What we [discovered] was something quite different.");

The strange thing was. this acrylia was darker than normal and instead of the normal golden hued veins it was covered with veins blacker than any darkness I've ever seen. I shadowed these grimlings to a grimling village some distance from the caverns where they exchanged some of this [black acrylia] with others of their kind.");

The difficulty of obtaining the [necessary supplies] for crafting the black acrylia however prevents the Validus Custodus and Magus Conlegium from doing extensive research of the strange ore.");

I saw this substance during my observations and after many attempts we seem to have discovered its [ingredients].");
    elseif(e.message:findi("ingredients")) then
        e.self:Say("We believe the grimlings brew a mixture of Essence of Darkness. Akheva Blood. and Distilled Mana to create the temper. We have attempted this formulae and it does indeed seem to enhance the innate magical powers of the black acrylia ore. allowing it to be crafted into weapons of terrible devastation. Be careful what you do with this knowledge friend. I would hate for the Inquisition to find the means of equipping their legions with weapons the likes of which I have described.");
