The other governors have placed me in charge of deciphering the nature of the recent epidemic of undead [attacks] within our city's walls. I would assign some of the guards to handle this matter, but I feel that it may be best for someone who is not as well known to get more information on these attacks. Not that I do not trust our guards, mind you.");

We have noticed that the undead there have all been covered in what appears to be the same set of arcane symbols.  I will need a complete set of those symbols to progress any further in my research.  Oddly enough, the last set that I had was removed from my quarters without my authorization.  Just make sure this set is completely legible.  The skin samples must not be damaged. Do you think you can handle this matter?");

        e.self:Say("Please, place the skin samples in the separate trays within this box and return it to me.  Maybe, I'll have an idea of what to do from there by the time you're done. Thank you for your assistance. Good hunting.");

I've seen these glyphs in some of her books. Please take the note that I just handed you to the courier that is waiting at the gate in Tenebrous. I will alert the other governors and get the guards mobilized. Colain Jasior should not make it out of the city, but the courier will ensure that she has no place to run to if she does.");
