We need you to infiltrate Sanctus Seru and bring back reports from each Consillium. I do not know who will have these reports, and I have only heard rumor that they exist. Return to me with the Satchel full, and your Etched Earring.");

Stay clear of the Arx Seru, the central building. This is the resting place of Seru, who does not allow anyone but the Praesertum to disturb him. To venture inside is death for all that are not invited.");
	elseif e.message:findi("who is Seru") then
		e.self:Say("Seru is the genius behind the Combine Empire. A man of unfailing honor and honesty, he devised the Inquisition, to root out unclean elements in the Empire. His saddest day was when he discovered that Katta himself was a traitor. When confronted with proof of his treachery, Katta feigned his own murder, and fled to Luclin. Seru had no choice but to amass an expedition and follow after him.");

We have been watching someone named Vahn enter the city under the guise of a trader. We know he works for Seru, but we were not sure what he was doing here, so we let him be- trouble was he kept giving us the slip passing through the tunnels. Looks now like we may have found a connection. The plan sounds complicated and I don't want to confuse you, but if you stick with me it will all go just fine. You with me so far, %s?", e.other:GetName()));

Keep this stone on you, it is imbued with the power to record anything spoken within a certain distance and will be a great asset to us when this is all said and done. If Claudius does meet up with Vahn, I want you to walk right up to him and say, 'traitor to the Validus Custodus' and do it quickly- they won't give you much time. That should rattle him a bit and it will be the signal for my men to come in and take care of them. After the arrest, just give that recording stone to Condor. Best of luck to you, %s.", e.other:GetName()));
